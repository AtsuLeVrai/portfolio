# Portfolio "AtsuLeVrai" - A Visual Narrative Experience

*Inspired by Beat Saber's legendary maps "you" by Swifter and "Lifelike" by nasafrasa from Extra Sensory II*

> **"Talk to yourself but don't listen to yourself"**  
> — The story of an autodidact developer's breakthrough

---

## 🎭 **The Story**

This portfolio tells the story of a developer's journey from **CM2 Scratch experiments** to **backend mastery** — a
narrative of perfectionism, self-doubt, and finally breaking through to create something extraordinary.

Like Swifter's "you" represents "the end of a chapter and the start of a new one," this portfolio marks my transition
from **hiding behind perfectionism** to **shipping with confidence**.

## 🎵 **Visual Narrative Structure**

### **Act I: Loading - "Buildup Chaos" (Inspired by "you" 1:24-1:36)**

```
🌸 Luminous flower blooms in darkness
💥 Energy explosions cascade around the viewer  
✨ Floating particles gather momentum
🌿 Veins of light spread across the void
🔮 Buildup sphere pulses with anticipation
```

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Three.js**: Custom shaders for luminous flower geometry
- **@react-three/postprocessing**: Bloom effects for energy explosions
- **Anime.js**: Staggered particle animations with easing curves
- **Howler.js**: Audio-reactive buildup sync (even without music)

### **Act II: Revelation - "Glass Awakening" (Inspired by "you" 0:30-1:24)**

```
⚡ Sudden flash reveals the developer's workspace
🪟 Glass-like surfaces reflect code snippets
✨ Translucent elements showcase tech stack
🌌 Ambient lighting creates dreamy atmosphere
```

**Hero Section:** Introduction with glassmorphism effects, floating code blocks, and gentle camera movements creating
an "out of body" developer experience.

### **Act III: Immersion - "Living Portfolio" (Inspired by "Lifelike")**

```
🌱 Environment breaks apart to reveal projects
☀️ Day/night cycle during skills showcase
🌧️ Ambient weather effects during transitions
💎 Realistic materials with proper reflections
🎯 Perfect music-visual synchronization
```

**About & Skills:** Dynamic environment that evolves - from confined dark space to open landscapes. Skills bars grow
like organic matter, achievements bloom like flowers.

### **Act IV: The Drop - "Project Showcase Explosion"**

```
🚀 Complete environment transformation
🎆 Visual deference with particle systems
⚡ Real-time shader effects
🌈 Color explosions synchronized to interactions
🔥 Maximum visual impact showcase
```

**Projects Section:** Each project triggers a complete scene change with cinematic transitions. GitHub stats materialize
as 3D data visualizations.

### **Act V: Outro - "Personal Message"**

```
🌅 Peaceful conclusion environment
💬 "Talk to yourself but don't listen to yourself"
📧 Contact form with subtle animations
🕊️ Gentle fade to leave lasting impression
```

## 🎨 **Design Philosophy**

### **Color Palette: "Floral Awakening"**

```css
:root {
    --bloom-pink: #ffb3d9
    --soft-rose: #ffd6cc
    --warm-beige: #f5e6d3
    --glass-white: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)
    --energy-coral: #ff9999
    --ambient-cream: #fff8e1
}
```

### **Typography & Motion**

- **Headings**: Bold, confident statements that materialize with particle effects
- **Body**: Readable, flowing text that animates organically
- **Code**: Monospace elements that glitch into existence
- **Motion**: Every animation serves the narrative - no gratuitous effects

## 💭 **Personal Statement**

At 17, I've been coding for nearly a decade - from **Scratch in CM2** to **backend mastery today**. I've always been my
own worst critic, perfectionism keeping projects in the shadows.

This portfolio represents my **breakthrough moment** - like Swifter finally collaborating with Vivify after years of
dreaming. It's time to stop talking to myself and start showing the world what I can create.

**Backend Engineer. Trading Aspirant. Future Game Maker.**  
*Currently exploring Zig while building the next generation of Discord tooling.*

---

## 🤝 **Collaboration & Opportunities**

I'm seeking:

- **Freelance Backend Projects** - Scalable APIs and infrastructure
- **Trading Technology** - Building financial tools and systems
- **Game Development** - Backend services for multiplayer games
- **Open Source** - Contributing to impactful JavaScript ecosystem tools

**Let's build something extraordinary together.**
